* Only wood coasters that operated in 2017 are listed on the ballot

* You may delete all these * STARRED LINES * as well as the lines for any coasters you haven’t ridden.
* If you do not want to delete lines, simply leave the rank as 0 for coasters you haven't ridden. 
* Deleting lines is completely optional, but it may make it easier to work with your ballot, especially if your ride list is long.

* To rank your coasters, replace the 0 at the beginning of the line with the number of your ranking.
* Please leave the comma after the number.
* Your favourite coaster will get ranked 1, your second-favourite coaster will get ranked 2, etc
* Rank in whole numbers only. Do not use fractions or decimal points.
* Ties are allowed.
* Continue until you've ranked every coaster that you've ridden.

* DO NOT RANK coasters that you have not ridden

* You may also re-order the lines on your ballot so that your ballot reads
* from best to worst, if that makes it easier to visualize.
* This is fine, as long as you don't change any character in the coaster's name.
* If the coaster name on your ballot doesn't match the original
* text exactly, that coaster will be discarded and not counted (but the rest of your ballot will still be counted.)

* When you are finished, save your ballot with the filename of your choosing
* (the file must be saved in the same format as it was downloaded - .txt for text, docx for Word, etc)
* Then email it as an attachment to:
* editor@ellocoaster.com
* Use the subject line "2017 Wood Coaster Poll"

* PLEASE NOTE *
* RMC Topper Track coasters are listed on this poll as wood coasters
* If you do not count those as woodies, simply delete them from your ballot or leave the ranking at "0"
* DO NOT give them a low ranking as a 'protest vote.' That is childish and immature. Don't be that person. ;-)

* Also, some people count racing coasters as single entities, others count each side as a separate coaster.
* Whichever camp you fall into, it doesn't matter.
* The sides are listed separately if you wish to assign separate rankings (yes, even the möbius ones).
* If you consider it a single ride, simply give each side the same rank... 
* But unless you've only ridden one side, please give both sides a ranking.
* Now, on to the ballot!
